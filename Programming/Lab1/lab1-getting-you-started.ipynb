In the end you will have 8 grades - one for each lab (NB: for lab sessions 8 and 9 you will work on the same notebook, so the grade you get for it will be taken into account twice). For your final grade for the PythonProg labs, we will take only your **best 5 out of the 8 grades**. This will make up **30% of your final grade** for the course.\n",

    "## Common mistakes\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of mistakes we frequently encounter when reviewing your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `print(result)` **instead of** `return result`. While these two might seem to produce the same thing, they are actually quite different. Whatever you pass to the `print()` function will be displayed on screen. When you use the `return` keyword, you stop the execution of a function and pass on its result to the script for further work.\n",
    "1. **Type mismatches!** When you test a function you've implemented, make sure that the arguments are of the correct type. For instance, the string `\"42\"` is different from the integer `42`. Python has a function `type(x)` that will tell you the type of the argument `x`.\n",
    "1. problems with Jupyter code **cells execution order**. While Jupyter is awesome when it comes to fiddling with script, often, you may be tempted to edit some code you've written in a previous cell, run this previous cell, and then go back to work wherever you were before that. As a result, other cells that depended on the previous implementation might cease to function properly! As a rule of thumb, you should make sure that cells are executed from top to bottom. **Tip:** the number in square brackets next to a code cell corresponds to the order in which you've ran the code cells.\n",
    "1. **Not testing your code after you've tweaked it.** Many, many silly mistakes come from not running your code once after doing \"just a simple modification\". Always test!"
