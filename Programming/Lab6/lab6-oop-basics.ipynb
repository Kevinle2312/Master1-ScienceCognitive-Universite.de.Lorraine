For the classes where you needed to expand the implementation for each exercise, you can submit only the final version of that class that cover all three exercises. Submit either a `.py` or an `.ipynb` file containing the classes and functions you wrote for the three exercises and name it `td6_firstname_lastname.py` or `td6_firstname_lastname.ipynb` accordingly, where `firstname` should be your first name and `lastname` should be your last name (e.h. Jane Doe's submission should be called `td6_jane_doe.py` or `td6_jane_doe.ipynb`, depending on whether Jane submitted a Python script or a Jupyter notebook).\n",

    "- Does your code run? (So **run** your program at least once before submitting!)\n",
    "- Does it run correctly? (So **test** your solution with a few different inputs!)\n",
