    "## Goals\n",
    "Welcome to your second lab day! \n",
    "The primary goal of this lab is to make sure that you master basic python syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of what we'll see during this lab is things you're already somewhat familiar with. As a consequence, many of the exercises are about correcting faulty syntax. Tracking and correcting buggy code, be it syntactically wrong or semantically faulty, is a major part of day-to-day programming. Better get you used to it!\n",
    "**Tip:** _Don't hesitate to open up previous class materials and refer to it, as it might prove helpful._\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** At the end of the lab are two exercises that you are expected to submit for grading on Arche. You will have until 9:59am on Friday, 30th September (just before our next lab) to submit. You will find the submission instructions at the end of this notebook."

    "## Being in the loop\n",

    "\n",
    "The second means of looping over instructions is called a `for` loop. It iterates over each element in a collection for instance, items in a list, or characters in a string), and stops when there are no more. Each element, in turn, is stored in the variable declared right after the `for` keyword. We put the collection after an `in` keyword. For example:\n",

    "\n",
    "One (somewhat) famous song in code programming is called [\"99 bottles of beer\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99_Bottles_of_Beer). It's frequently used to demonstrate the ability of a programming language to loop over a series of instructions. The song goes like this:\n",

    "You may have seen this problem before.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Collatz sequence* is an iterative sequence defined on the positive integers by:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "n -> n / 2    if n is even\n",
    "n -> 3n + 1   if n is odd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, using the rule above and starting with 13 yields the sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "13 -> 40 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. Although unproven, it it hypothesized that all starting numbers finish at 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the length of the longest chain which has a starting number under 1,000,000?\n",
    "\n",
    "*NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one thousand.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function called `collatz_len()`, which, given a number `n` (`n` <= 1,000,000), returns the length of the Collatz sequence starting at `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function called `max_collatz_len()`, which, given a number `n` (n <= 1,000,000), returns the length of the longest Collatz sequence for numbers smaller than `n`. (You are allowed to call your `collatz_len()` function within your `max_collatz_len()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: You may want to write a naive algorithm first which works for numbers under 1000. Then write a cleverer-than-naive algorithm so that is works for any starting number under 1,000,000. Or just go directly for the challenge ;-)\n",
    "\n",

    "max_collatz_len(1000) # => 179\n",
